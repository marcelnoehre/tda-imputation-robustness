# TDA Imputation Robustness
Empirical study to evaluate "The Robustness of Topological Data Analysis under Imputation-Induced Perturbations"

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

### 1. Create a Conda Environment
Run the following command to create a new conda environment with Python 3.11:

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.11
```

You can replace `myenv` with any other environment name you prefer.

### 2. Activate the Environment
Once the environment is created, activate it using:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

This ensures that you're working within the isolated environment.

### 3. Install Required Packages
Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary libraries and packages as listed in the requirements.txt file.

### 4. Additional Notes (Optional)
* If you need to update your environment or add new dependencies, modify the requirements.txt file and rerun the installation command:
* To deactivate the environment when you're done, simply run:

```bash
conda deactivate
```
